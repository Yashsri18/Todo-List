HTML: Defines the structure and layout of the web application, including elements such as the task list, input fields, and the date display.

CSS: Enhances the visual presentation and styling of the web application, providing a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

Express.js: A Node.js framework utilized to handle server-side operations, routing, and rendering dynamic content.
Features and Functionality:

Current Date Display: The web application prominently displays the current date, providing users with a quick reference point for their task management.

Task Creation: Users can add new tasks to the list by inputting task details in the provided input field and clicking the "Add" button. The newly added tasks are dynamically appended to the task list.

Work Page Access: By appending "/work" to the URL, users can access a separate page specifically dedicated to work-related tasks. This allows for better organization and differentiation between personal and work tasks.
